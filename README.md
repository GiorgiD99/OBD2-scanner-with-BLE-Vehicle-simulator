# OBD2-scanner-with-BLE-Vehicle-simulator

This code is part of the 15hp course "Projekt i Elektroteknik," where the objective was to create an OBD-II scanner equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities. Additionally, a vehicle/ECU simulator has been implemented.

The OBD-II scanner initiates requests for specific parameters from the simulator, and the simulator promptly responds with the requested data. The communication between them is facilitated through the use of CAN bus technology.
